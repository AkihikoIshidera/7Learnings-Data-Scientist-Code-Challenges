# 7Learnings Front-End Development Code Challenge

Hello potential 7Learnings colleague!
This coding challenge is an opportunity for you to demonstrate your skills and knowledge regarding front-end-development as well as 
your ability to work independently and use documentation where required. 
It is not about getting the right solution, try to get as far as you can we will discuss your approach and experience in the interview.

## The Challenge

You are tasked with implementing missing parts of [AppComponent](https://github.com/7Learnings/code-challenges/blob/700fc8dfc56e547014f1d3c8f0bf38ffa547ca49/frontend/src/app/app.component.ts).
Challenge description is provided in the comments of [`app.component.ts`](https://github.com/7Learnings/code-challenges/blob/700fc8dfc56e547014f1d3c8f0bf38ffa547ca49/frontend/src/app/app.component.ts#L51-L82).

The project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.5 ([installation instructions](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local#install-the-angular-cli)).

When all the prerequisites are met, you can install all required modules and serve the application:
 ```
 npm install
 ng serve --open
 ```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

#### Time Allotment

We respect your time and don't expect you to spend more than 3 hours on this. 
Try to get as far as you can, your solutions will then be discussed in the next interview, feel free to also add comments and explain what you intended to do. 

## What We Review

Your application will be reviewed by our engineers. The aspects of your code we will judge include:

- ability to get the technical environment set up 
- completion of tasks
    - User input 
    - Input validation
    - Handling observables
    - Error Handling
- code cleanness

## What We Do NOT Review
